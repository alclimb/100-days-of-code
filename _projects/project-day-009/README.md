# DAY 9: 2020-05-08
## (1) TODAY'S PROGRESS
- Studying Colors
  - I learned about tones.
- Experimenting with tween.js for tween animation
  - Switch between background and text colors with animation.

## (2) THOUGHTS
- When using colors, it was easier to keep them together if they were the same tone.
- This time, I tried to animate the deep-tone colors with each other.
